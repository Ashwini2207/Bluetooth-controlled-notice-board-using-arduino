# Bluetooth Controlled Notice Board Using Arduino

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Bluetooth controlled notice board using Arduino. 
Messages sent from a mobile phone through Bluetooth are received by Arduino and 
displayed instantly on an LCD display, eliminating the need for manual notice updates.

# Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Connecting Wires
- Breadboard
- Power Supply
- Android Mobile Phone


# Working Principle
1. A message is typed and sent from a mobile phone using a Bluetooth application.
2. The Bluetooth module (HC-05) receives the message wirelessly.
3. Arduino reads the received data through serial communication.
4. The received message is displayed on the LCD notice board.


# Advantages
- Wireless communication
